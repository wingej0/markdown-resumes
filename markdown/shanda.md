>  After graduating from high school in 2005, I spent two years at the College of Eastern Utah in Price, Utah.  I graduated with an Associate of Science in 2007, and I transferred to Southern Utah University in Cedar City, Utah where I completed my Bachelor of Arts with a major in English.  After graduating from SUU I moved back to Price, Utah where I worked for Utah State University in the distance education office.  In 2011 I was offered a teaching position in the high school English department at Pinnacle High School, where I enjoyed teaching for three years. I took a two year break from teaching to stay home with my young children. I was offered a secondary English teaching position in Emery School District in 2015, and worked there until May of 2021. My husband and I were offered positions with the San Juan School District in 2021, and I have been enjoying my time in San Juan High School's English department, where I also teach Concurrent Enrollment classes.
