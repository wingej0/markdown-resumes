>  In my 10 years as a public educator, I have experienced many unique challenges that have taught me some important truths. Teaching is about evolution. If you are not evolving, you are not being effective. Every student is capable of success; the trick is finding the right combination. Every student has the right to be heard, to see themselves represented in writing and literature, and to feel that educators are on their side.
